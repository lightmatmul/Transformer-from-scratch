# Transformer from Scratch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model as described in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. The implementation includes all necessary components such as multi-head attention, positional encoding, and feed-forward networks, with a sample usage.py to test on a generated random set.
