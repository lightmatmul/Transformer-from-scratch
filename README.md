# Transformer from Scratch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model as described in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. The implementation includes all necessary components such as multi-head attention, positional encoding, and feed-forward networks, with a sample usage.py to test on a generated random set.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github/transformer-from-scratch.git
cd transformer-from-scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the Transformer model, you can import it in your Python script or Jupyter notebook from the src directory. Here is a basic example of how to initialize and use the model:

```bash
from src.transformer import Transformer

# Initialize the Transformer with configuration parameters
transformer = Transformer(src_vocab_size=5000, tgt_vocab_size=5000, d_model=512,
                          num_heads=8, num_layers=6, d_ff=2048, max_seq_length=100,
                          dropout=0.1)

# Example of model usage
output = transformer(src_data, tgt_data)
```
